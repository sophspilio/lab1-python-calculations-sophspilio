# Lab 1 â€“ Calculations with Python
## Description of Script
This script finds the amount of rainfall (in inches) and runoff (in gallons) for one agricultural plot in Kenya. 

## Errors? 
I didn't encounter any errors or issues while creating this code, however I did have to google how to round the runoff_gallons value, but I found a quick example and figured that out without too much delay.
